### Server Program

- This server program was built and tested on **ubuntu2204-002**.

#### Instructions
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the server program files.
2. Run the server program using the following command:
    ```bash
    ./server.sh 'server_storage'
    ```
3. The terminal will display "Server n_port: `<n_port>`", where `<n_port>` is the port number on which the server is listening.

### Client Program

- This client program was built on **ubuntu2204-014**.

#### Instructions
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the client program files.
2. Run the client program using one of the following commands:
    - To upload (PUT) a file to the server:
        ```bash
        ./client.sh <server_addr> <n_port> PUT <filename>
        ```
    - To download (GET) a file from the server:
        ```bash
        ./client.sh <server_addr> <n_port> GET <filename>
        ```
    Replace `<server_addr>` with the server's IP address, `<n_port>` with the server's port number (obtained from the server output), and `<filename>` with the name of the file to be uploaded or downloaded.
